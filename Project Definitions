design desicions:

1. matrix objects should be IMMUTABLE

2. we will use "malloc-free" 

3.matrices use "double"

4.Define and use data structures:
VECTOR:
        "data" - array of floats
        "length" - unsigned int
MATRIX:
        "data" - array of COLUMN array
        "num_rows" - unsigned int
        "num_columns" - unsigned int
JACOBI_MATRIX:
        "i" unsined int
        "j" unsined int
        "c" unsined int
        "s" unsined int
DIAGONAL_MATRIX
        alias of a vector :)
        with typedef

use typedef vector_t *vector (because shai said so, and will explain in near future)
